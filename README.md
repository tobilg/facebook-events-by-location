# Search Facebook events by location (as a service)
A Express.js-based webservice to get public Facebook events by location. It can be used as a starting point for an location-based app for example.

As Facebook has discontinued the FQL query API for all apps created after 2014-04-30, it has gotten much more complicated to get public Facebook events by passing a location.

This implementation uses regular Facebook Graph API calls in a three-step approach to get the events:

1. Search for places in the radius of the passed coordinate and distance (`/search?type=place&q=*&center={coordinate}&distance={distance}`)
2. Use the places to query for their events in parallel (`/?ids={id1},{id2},{id3},...`)
3. Unify, filter and sort the results from the parallel calls and return them to the client

Please consider that distance refers to the radius with respect to the latitude and longitude of the location in meters.
###Known limitations

* The Graph API has some "instabilities" with search results. It's possible that the amount of results returned can vary between calls within seconds
* The `/search` endpoint "magically" limits the number of results, independent from the `distance` used (larger distance doesn't guarantee more results)
* [Rate limiting](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/advanced/rate-limiting) will apply, but I experienced no call blocks within a reasonable amount of service requests. Be aware that the way this application works, there are potentially hundreds of (counted) Graph API calls per request to `/events`.

##Installation

### As NPM package
The application can be installed via 

`npm install facebook-events-by-location`

in the root directory, and either started with 

`npm start` or `node app.js`.

#### Git
To clone the repository, use

`git clone https://github.com/tobilg/facebook-events-by-location.git`

and run `cd facebook-events-by-location && npm i && npm start` to install the dependencies and run the web service.

### As Docker microservice
You can build the Docker image via `docker build -t <yourTag> .` locally if you like. Also, there's an [official image](https://hub.docker.com/r/tobilg/facebook-event-search/) (called `tobilg/facebook-event-search`) in the Docker hub.
 
The service can be launched via Docker like this:

`docker run -d --name fb-event-search -p 3000:3000 tobilg/facebook-event-search`

This would expose the app on port 3000 on the Docker host. If you want to specify another port for the app, you can use `-e "APP_PORT=10000"` together with `--net="host"` (be aware of the security implications of host networking). 

##API
The basic endpoint is `/events`, the port of the application can be set via environment variable.

###Query paramenters
Mandatory parameters are the following:

* `lat`: The latitude of the position/coordinate the events shall be returned for
* `lng`: The longitude of the position/coordinate the events shall be returned for
* `distance`: The distance in meters (it makes sense to use smaller distances, like max. 2500)
* `access_token`: The **App Access Token** to be used for the requests to the Graph API

Non-mandatory parameters

* `sort`: The results can be sorted by `time`, `distance`, `venue` or `popularity`. If omitted, the events will be returned in the order they were received from the Graph API

###Query results
The response will be `application/json` and contain an `events` property containing the array of event objects, as well as a `metadata` property with some stats. See below for an example.

###Sample call

`http://localhost:3000/events?lat=40.710803&lng=-73.964040&distance=1000&sort=venue&access_token=YOUR_APP_ACCESS_TOKEN` (make sure you replace `YOUR_APP_ACCESS_TOKEN` with a real access token!)
